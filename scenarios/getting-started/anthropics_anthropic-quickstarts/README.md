This CLAUDE.md file from Anthropic's official quickstarts repository demonstrates how to document multiple related projects within a single guide, providing clear getting-started patterns for diverse AI applications.

## Key Features That Make This Exemplary

### 1. **Multi-Project Organization**
- Documents three distinct applications (Computer-Use Demo, Customer Support Agent, Financial Data Analyst)
- Each project has its own setup and development section
- Maintains consistency across different tech stacks (Python, TypeScript, React)

### 2. **Clear Technology Separation**
- Computer-Use Demo: Python with Docker containerization
- Customer Support Agent: Node.js with React and multiple UI variants
- Financial Data Analyst: TypeScript with data visualization focus

### 3. **Practical Development Commands**
- Provides essential commands for each project type
- Includes Docker setup for complex environments
- Shows multiple development modes (full UI, variants, chat-only)

### 4. **Code Quality Standards**
- Consistent linting and formatting across all projects
- Type checking for both Python (pyright) and TypeScript
- Testing patterns with pytest for Python projects

## Unique Techniques

### **Multi-Stack Documentation**
Shows how to document multiple technology stacks within a single file while maintaining clarity and avoiding confusion.

### **Docker Integration**
Demonstrates comprehensive Docker setup with complex port mappings and volume mounts for the Computer-Use Demo.

### **UI Variant Management**
Documents multiple UI configurations for the Customer Support Agent, showing how to handle different deployment scenarios.

### **Getting Started Focus**
Keeps documentation focused on immediate developer needs - setup, development, and quality checks.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Organize by Project**: When documenting multiple projects, maintain clear section boundaries
2. **Consistent Patterns**: Apply similar structure and naming conventions across different tech stacks
3. **Focus on Essentials**: Prioritize setup, development, and quality commands over deep architecture details
4. **Docker Ready**: Include containerization setup for complex environments

This approach shows how official quickstart documentation can effectively onboard developers to multiple AI applications while maintaining clarity and consistency across different technology stacks.
