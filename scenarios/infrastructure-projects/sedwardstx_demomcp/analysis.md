- **Process management tools** for system administration
- **Resource monitoring** with performance metrics collection

### 3. Type Safety and Validation
Modern Python development practices:
- **Pydantic model validation** for type safety
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Configuration-driven architecture** for flexibility

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **MCP Server Development**: Learn how to build Model Context Protocol servers that safely expose system resources to AI assistants
2. **Cross-Platform System Access**: Understand patterns for accessing system resources across different operating systems
3. **Async System Operations**: See how to implement non-blocking system operations with proper error handling

## Why This Example Was Selected

This example fills a critical gap in our collection by:
- **First comprehensive MCP server example** - demonstrates cutting-edge AI integration patterns
- **System administration focus** - shows how to safely expose system resources to AI assistants
- **Production-ready architecture** - includes proper error handling, logging, and configuration management

The combination of MCP protocol implementation with system administration makes this example particularly valuable for developers building AI-integrated infrastructure tools and monitoring systems.
