## Why This Example Was Selected

This CLAUDE.md file represents an outstanding example of **Libraries & Frameworks** for high-performance Python libraries:

### 1. **Performance-Critical Library Design**
DataFog is a high-performance PII detection library with specific performance requirements:
- Rust bindings and FFI integration patterns
- Memory-efficient algorithm implementation
- Benchmarking and performance measurement
- Performance regression testing strategies

### 2. **Security and Privacy Focus**
As a PII detection and anonymization library:
- Security-first development practices
- Privacy compliance considerations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Sensitive data handling patterns
- Cryptographic implementation guidance

### 3. **Machine Learning Integration**
The library involves ML/AI components for PII detection:
- Model training and inference patterns
- Feature engineering for text analysis
- ML model deployment and packaging
- Training data management and validation

### 4. **Cross-Language Integration**
Integration with multiple language ecosystems:
- Python-Rust FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- Native extension development patterns
- Cross-platform compilation requirements
- Performance optimization across language boundaries

### 5. **Enterprise Library Standards**
Professional library development practices:
- Comprehensive testing for sensitive functionality
- Documentation standards for enterprise adoption
- API stability and backward compatibility
- Compliance and audit trail requirements

## Key Takeaways for claude.md Best Practices

1. **Performance Documentation**: Include specific performance characteristics and optimization guidance
2. **Security Standards**: Document security practices and compliance requirements
3. **Cross-Language Architecture**: Address FFI and native extension development patterns
4. **Enterprise Requirements**: Include guidance for enterprise-grade reliability and compliance
5. **ML Integration**: Document machine learning workflow integration and model management
6. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Provide clear guidance for working with sensitive data safely

This example demonstrates how a claude.md for a performance-critical, security-focused library should address not just the technical implementation, but also the broader context of compliance, security, and enterprise adoption requirements.
