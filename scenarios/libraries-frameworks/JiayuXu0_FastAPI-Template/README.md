## Category Assignment

**Category**: `libraries-frameworks`

**Rationale**: This FastAPI template demonstrates production-ready patterns for enterprise Python backend development with comprehensive three-layer architecture (API → Service → Repository → Model), providing excellent educational material for modern async Python web development. It fills a critical gap in the collection for developers building scalable backend services.

## Why This Example Was Selected

This FastAPI template demonstrates production-ready patterns for enterprise Python backend development with comprehensive three-layer architecture (API → Service → Repository → Model).

### Unique Features

1. **Structured Development Workflow**: Step-by-step guide from model definition through testing, with detailed commands for every development task
2. **Enterprise Security Practices**: Complete RBAC implementation, JWT authentication, rate limiting, and security audit logging
3. **Production Checklist**: Concrete security and deployment guidelines with validation steps
4. **Comprehensive Type Safety**: Async-first architecture with full type annotations throughout the codebase

### What Makes It Stand Out

- **Three-Layer Architecture Documentation**: Clear separation of API, Service, and Repository layers with dependency injection patterns
- **Feature Development Flow**: Documents complete workflow from database model to API endpoint with validation
- **Security Integration**: Shows how RBAC, authentication, caching, file management, and audit logging work together cohesively
- **Modern Python Tooling**: Uses contemporary async patterns, Pydantic validation, and SQLAlchemy ORM best practices

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Architectural Patterns**: Learn how to structure a scalable FastAPI application with clear layer separation and dependency injection
2. **Security Best Practices**: Implement enterprise-grade security with RBAC, JWT authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging
3. **Development Workflow**: Follow a systematic approach to adding new features from database design to API implementation and testing
