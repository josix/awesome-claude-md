## Category Assignment

**Category**: `libraries-frameworks`

**Rationale**: This is the first Elixir example in the collection, demonstrating functional programming patterns for time-series data processing with a unified API across multiple database backends (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis). It showcases Elixir-idiomatic patterns including fluent API design, pattern matching, and driver abstraction. Demonstrates the repository's commitment to quality content over popularity metrics.

## Why This Example Was Selected

This comprehensive Elixir library demonstrates functional programming patterns for time-series data processing with a unified API across multiple database backends. As the first Elixir example in our collection, it introduces developers to functional programming approaches for data analytics.

### Unique Features

1. **Multi-Driver Architecture**: Unified API across MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Redis with consistent behavior
2. **Fluent API Design**: Elixir-idiomatic data series processing with pipeline-friendly operations
3. **Precision Arithmetic**: Uses Decimal library for accurate statistical calculations without floating-point errors
4. **Pattern Matching**: Leverages Elixir's pattern matching strengths for elegant data transformation

### What Makes It Stand Out

- **Driver Abstraction Layer**: Clean separation between API and storage implementation with pluggable backends
- **Functional Design**: Pure functions, immutable data structures, and composable operations
- **Time-Series Optimizations**: Built-in support for ranges, aggregations, and temporal queries
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite demonstrating driver testing patterns

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Elixir Library Design**: Learn idiomatic patterns for building Elixir libraries with comprehensive driver abstraction
2. **Functional Programming**: Apply functional programming principles to time-series data processing and analytics
3. **Multi-Backend Support**: Implement consistent APIs across different storage engines with driver abstraction patterns
