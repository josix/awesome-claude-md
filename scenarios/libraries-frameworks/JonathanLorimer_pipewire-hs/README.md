## Overview

A comprehensive Haskell library providing safe bindings to PipeWire, demonstrating a layered architectural approach to FFI (Foreign Function Interface) binding generation. This project showcases systematic binding development with automated generation and type safety.

## Why This Example Is Exceptional

### 1. Layered Architecture Design
- **Generated Layer**: Automatic bindings from hs-bindgen
- **Safe Layer**: Memory-safe wrappers around raw bindings
- **High-Level Layer**: Idiomatic Haskell API for end users

### 2. Automated FFI Generation
- Uses hs-bindgen for systematic binding generation
- Emphasis on type safety and memory management
- Modular approach to complex system integration

### 3. Comprehensive Development Guidelines
- Detailed setup and binding generation process
- Clear coding preferences and design decisions
- Systematic testing recommendations and workflow

## Key Takeaways

1. **Layered Binding Strategy**: Demonstrates how to structure complex FFI projects with clear separation between generated, safe, and idiomatic layers.

2. **Automated Development Tools**: Shows the effective use of binding generators (hs-bindgen) to reduce manual work while maintaining safety and correctness.

3. **Type Safety Focus**: Emphasizes memory safety and proper resource management in system-level library bindings, crucial for robust Haskell applications.
