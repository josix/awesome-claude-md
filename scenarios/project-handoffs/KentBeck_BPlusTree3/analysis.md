## Project Context

Kent Beck's BPlusTree3 is a research project implementing B+ tree data structures in Rust, focused on demonstrating disciplined Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. As one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto and creator of Extreme Programming, Kent Beck uses this project to showcase methodical software development with AI assistance. The project serves as both a working implementation and a case study in rigorous development practices.

## Onboarding Guidance

The CLAUDE.md file prioritizes methodology over technology, establishing clear development principles before diving into implementation details:
- **Role Definition**: Establishes AI as a "senior software engineer" with specific responsibilities
- **Process First**: Introduces TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor) as the primary workflow
- **External References**: Connects AI to existing project documentation (`plan.md`) for dynamic guidance
- **Quality Standards**: Sets non-negotiable quality gates and commit requirements

## AI Instructions

This file demonstrates sophisticated AI behavioral guidance through explicit constraints:

### **Methodological Constraints**
- "Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementing features"
- "NEVER write production code that contains panic!() statements"
- "implement only enough code to make that test pass"

### **Role-Based Instructions**
Establishes the AI as a "senior software engineer" with specific expertise expectations and decision-making authority within defined boundaries.

### **Workflow Integration**
Uses imperative commands like "When I say 'go', find the next unmarked test" to create predictable interaction patterns.

### **Quality Enforcement**
Provides comprehensive code quality standards with explicit patterns to avoid and preferred alternatives.

## Strengths

### 1. **Disciplined Development Process**
- **Description**: Enforces strict TDD methodology with clear cycle requirements
- **Implementation**: Explicit Red → Green → Refactor workflow with "Tidy First" principles
- **Impact**: Prevents AI from taking shortcuts that violate established development practices

### 2. **Comprehensive Quality Standards**
- **Description**: Establishes non-negotiable code quality requirements with specific examples
- **Implementation**: Lists dangerous patterns vs. preferred patterns with code examples
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent, production-ready code quality across all AI contributions

### 3. **External Documentation Integration**
- **Description**: References project-specific documentation for dynamic guidance
- **Implementation**: Links to `plan.md` for task sequencing and current project state
- **Impact**: Creates bridge between static AI guidance and evolving project needs

### 4. **Behavioral Constraints for AI**
- **Description**: Constrains how AI approaches tasks, not just what to do
- **Implementation**: Specific commands like "find the next unmarked test" and "implement only enough"
- **Impact**: Maintains development discipline while leveraging AI assistance

## Weaknesses

### Limited Technical Context
- **Issue**: Focuses heavily on methodology with minimal technical architecture guidance
- **Impact**: AI may need additional context about Rust-specific patterns and project structure
- **Suggestion**: Include brief section on project architecture and key data structures

## Notable Patterns

### Methodology-First Documentation
```markdown
## Code Quality Standards

NEVER write production code that contains:
1. **panic!() statements in normal operation paths** - always return Result<T, Error>
2. **memory leaks** - every allocation must have corresponding deallocation

ALWAYS:
1. **Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementing features**
2. **Include invariant validation in data structures**
```
**Explanation**: Establishes behavioral constraints before technical details, ensuring AI follows established practices regardless of specific implementation challenges.

### Role-Based AI Guidance
```markdown
You are a senior software engineer following specific principles:
- TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)
- "Tidy First" separation of structural vs behavioral changes
```
**Explanation**: Sets clear expectations for AI expertise level and decision-making authority within defined boundaries.

### External Reference Integration
```markdown
Reference external documentation (plan.md) for task sequencing
When I say 'go', find the next unmarked test
```
**Explanation**: Creates dynamic connection between static AI guidance and evolving project documentation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Methodology Over Technology**: Establish development process constraints before technical guidance
2. **Behavioral AI Guidance**: Constrain how AI approaches tasks, not just what tasks to perform
3. **Quality Standards First**: Set non-negotiable quality requirements with specific examples
4. **External Documentation Links**: Connect AI to existing project workflows and documentation
