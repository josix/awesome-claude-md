## Project Context

CYRUP AI's Kargo project demonstrates advanced AI-assisted development methodologies through comprehensive state machine workflows. The project focuses on Rust development with sophisticated MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool integration, representing one of the most comprehensive AI assistant configuration files in the ecosystem. It serves as both a working development environment and a methodology showcase for structured AI collaboration.

## Onboarding Guidance

The CLAUDE.md file establishes sophisticated development workflows from the start:
- **State Machine Orientation**: Clear development phases with defined transitions and time allocations
- **Research-First Approach**: 80/20 split between research and implementation phases
- **Tool Ecosystem Mastery**: Comprehensive documentation of all available MCP tools and capabilities
- **Methodology Integration**: Complete workflow that combines human expertise with AI capabilities

## AI Instructions

Demonstrates advanced AI behavioral guidance through structured state management:

### **State Machine Workflow**
Defines explicit development phases: Initial → Research & Planning (80%) → Implementation (20%) → Review → Complete, with clear transition criteria.

### **Research-First Methodology**
Enforces systematic investigation using GitHub search as primary intelligence source before code implementation.

### **Tool Integration Patterns**
Provides comprehensive MCP tool reference with parameter specifications, capabilities, and limitations.

### **Resilience and Recovery Strategies**
Implements retry budgets, adaptive search strategies, and escalation paths for handling failures and edge cases.

### **Motivational Elements**
Incorporates encouraging language ("_Slow down ... deep breath_. You're amazing.") to manage AI behavior and confidence.

## Strengths

### 1. **State Machine Architecture**
- **Description**: Structured development workflow with explicit phases and transitions
- **Implementation**: Clear progression through Initial → Research (80%) → Implementation (20%) → Review → Complete
- **Impact**: Ensures systematic approach and prevents premature implementation

### 2. **Comprehensive Tool Documentation**
- **Description**: Complete reference manual for all available MCP tools with specifications
- **Implementation**: Parameter documentation with required/optional indicators, capabilities mapping
- **Impact**: Maximizes AI tool utilization and creates self-documenting development environment

### 3. **Adaptive Failure Recovery**
- **Description**: Systematic approaches to handling different types of failures and edge cases
- **Implementation**: Retry budgets, adaptive search strategies, escalation paths
- **Impact**: Creates resilient development workflow that handles real-world complexity

### 4. **Research-Heavy Methodology**
- **Description**: Prioritizes understanding existing solutions before new implementation
- **Implementation**: 80/20 research-to-implementation ratio, GitHub search as primary intelligence
- **Impact**: Reduces duplicate work and leverages existing knowledge effectively

## Weaknesses

### Complexity Barrier for Simple Tasks
- **Issue**: Sophisticated state machine workflow may be excessive for simple development tasks
- **Impact**: Could slow down rapid prototyping or simple bug fixes
- **Suggestion**: Add "Express Mode" for simple changes that bypass full research workflow

## Notable Patterns

### State Machine Workflow
```markdown
## Development Phases
1. **Initial**: Task understanding and planning
2. **Research & Planning (80%)**: GitHub search and solution analysis
3. **Implementation (20%)**: Code development based on research
4. **Review**: Quality validation and testing
5. **Complete**: Final documentation and handoff
```
**Explanation**: Explicit state management ensures systematic progression and prevents common AI pitfalls like premature optimization or insufficient research.

### Research-First Methodology
```markdown
## Research Requirements
- 80% of effort on research and planning
- GitHub search as primary intelligence source
- Adaptive search strategies for failed queries
- Documentation of findings before implementation
```
**Explanation**: Prioritizes understanding over action, reducing duplicate work and leveraging community knowledge.

### Tool Integration Reference
```markdown
## MCP Tool Documentation
- **file_operations**: File system management (required: path, optional: content)
- **github_search**: Repository intelligence (required: query, optional: filters)
- **code_analysis**: Static analysis tools (required: target, optional: depth)
```
**Explanation**: Comprehensive tool documentation enables AI to maximize available capabilities and understand constraints.

### Adaptive Failure Recovery
```markdown
## Error Handling Strategy
1. Retry with refined parameters (3 attempts)
2. Alternative search strategies if initial approach fails
3. Escalation to human review for unresolvable issues
4. Learning from failures to improve future queries
```
**Explanation**: Systematic approach to handling real-world development complexity and edge cases.

## Key Takeaways

1. **State-Driven Development**: Structure AI workflows as explicit state machines with clear transitions and time allocation
2. **Research-Heavy Approach**: Prioritize understanding existing solutions before implementing new code
3. **Tool Mastery Documentation**: Provide comprehensive reference for all available tools to maximize AI capabilities
4. **Systematic Failure Recovery**: Build in retry strategies and escalation paths for handling complex real-world scenarios
