## Why This Example is Valuable

This repository provides a comprehensive example of building **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** with modern cloud infrastructure. It demonstrates clean integration patterns between AI tools, authentication systems, and serverless deployment.

### Key Features That Make It Stand Out

1. **MCP Server Implementation**: Complete MCP server for AI image generation using Cloudflare Workers
2. **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leverages Cloudflare AI, R2 storage, KV namespaces, and Durable Objects
3. **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth integration with optional domain restrictions
4. **Development Workflow**: Clear local development setup with production deployment paths

### Educational Highlights

- **Serverless AI Integration**: Shows how to build AI-powered tools on edge computing platforms
- **MCP Protocol Patterns**: Demonstrates proper MCP server structure and tool definitions
- **Cloud Storage Management**: Efficient image storage and retrieval using Cloudflare R2
- **Authentication Best Practices**: Secure OAuth implementation with configurable access controls

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **MCP Development**: Learn how to create custom MCP servers that extend AI assistant capabilities
2. **Cloudflare Workers Patterns**: Understand modern serverless architecture with AI model integration
3. **Secure Service Design**: Implement authentication and authorization for AI-powered APIs
