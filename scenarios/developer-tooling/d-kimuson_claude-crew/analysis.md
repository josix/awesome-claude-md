This CLAUDE.md file from Claude Crew demonstrates exemplary TypeScript development standards with strict typing and comprehensive tooling integration.

## Key Features That Make This Exemplary

### 1. **Comprehensive Build System**
- Uses pnpm for package management with parallel builds
- Separate schema building step for type generation
- Integrated linting with multiple tools (cspell, prettier, eslint)
- Vitest for modern testing framework

### 2. **Strict TypeScript Standards**
- Enforces strict typing with no `any` or non-null assertions
- Detailed import ordering rules for consistency
- Prefers `type` over `interface` for better type safety
- Property-style method signatures for cleaner code

### 3. **Professional Error Handling**
- Custom `DiscriminatedError` for typed error handling
- Centralized error handling with `unhandledError`
- Strict rules against type assertions
- Clear commenting standards for type overrides

### 4. **Code Quality Automation**
- Auto-fixing capabilities with `pnpm fix`
- Multiple linting layers (spelling, formatting, code quality)
- Comprehensive type checking integration
- Clear testing workflow with single-file testing

## Unique Techniques

### **Strict No-Assertion Policy**
Takes a hard stance against type assertions with `assertionStyle: "never"`, forcing developers to write more type-safe code.

### **Comprehensive Import Ordering**
Provides detailed import ordering rules that create consistent, readable code structure across the entire project.

### **Typed Error Handling**
Uses `DiscriminatedError` for type-safe error handling, moving away from generic Error objects.

### **Professional Comment Standards**
Enforces `@ts-expect-error` with descriptions while prohibiting `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck`, maintaining code quality.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enforce Strict Standards**: Use tooling to enforce coding standards rather than relying on developer discipline
2. **Automate Quality**: Provide auto-fixing capabilities to reduce friction in maintaining code quality
3. **Type Safety First**: Prioritize type safety over convenience, even when it requires more work
4. **Comprehensive Tooling**: Integrate multiple quality tools (linting, formatting, type checking) into a unified workflow

This approach demonstrates how to create a professional TypeScript development environment with strict standards that are enforced through tooling rather than just documentation.
