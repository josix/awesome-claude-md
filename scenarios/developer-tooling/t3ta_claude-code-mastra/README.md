## Category Assignment

**Category**: `developer-tooling`

**Rationale**: This integration library demonstrates clean adapter patterns for AI SDK interoperability, specifically bridging Claude Code SDK with Mastra (an AI agent framework). It showcases essential patterns for tool conflict resolution, protocol translation, and session lifecycle management. Valuable for developers building integrations between different AI frameworks and SDKs.

## Why This Example Was Selected

This focused integration library demonstrates clean adapter patterns for bridging Claude Code SDK with the Mastra framework (an AI agent development framework), showing excellent session management and tool conflict resolution. Mastra provides infrastructure for building AI agents, and this adapter enables seamless integration with Claude Code tooling.

### Unique Features

1. **Tool Bridge Architecture**: Automatic conflict resolution between different SDK tools with intelligent merging
2. **Message Conversion**: Multi-layer message format translation between Claude Code and Mastra protocols
3. **Session Lifecycle Management**: Automatic 30-second cleanup using WeakMap for ephemeral connections
4. **JSON Tool Processing**: Intelligent tool call detection and parsing with error handling

### What Makes It Stand Out

- **Adapter Pattern Excellence**: Clean separation of concerns with protocol translation layer
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup with WeakMap to prevent memory leaks
- **Tool Deduplication**: Smart handling of overlapping tool definitions from multiple sources
- **TypeScript Best Practices**: Full type safety with comprehensive interface definitions

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Framework Adapters**: Learn how to create clean adapters between different AI framework SDKs
2. **Session Management**: Implement ephemeral connection patterns with automatic cleanup and resource management
3. **Tool Integration**: Handle tool registration conflicts and build unified tool interfaces across frameworks
