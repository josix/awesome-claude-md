# openshift/rosa - Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS CLI

## Category: Developer Tooling

**Rationale**: This repository represents a sophisticated CLI tool for managing enterprise Kubernetes infrastructure, demonstrating excellent patterns for developer tooling documentation, command structure, and professional development workflows.

## Source Information

## Why This Example is Exemplary

This CLAUDE.md file demonstrates exceptional developer tooling documentation with several standout features:

### 1. Clear Role Definition and Boundaries
Establishes explicit boundaries for AI assistance: "Everything submitted in an MR is on the human submitter, not Claude Code" - demonstrating professional accountability in enterprise development.

### 2. Structured Development Constraints
Provides specific prohibitions and guidelines that prevent autonomous actions while enabling productive collaboration, particularly important for enterprise tooling projects.

### 3. Comprehensive Technical Context
Offers detailed information about Go development patterns, testing approaches, and project structure that enables effective AI-assisted development while maintaining code quality.

### 4. Professional Development Framework
Emphasizes human oversight, existing project patterns, and verification requirements - critical for enterprise-grade developer tools.

### 5. Ethical AI Integration
Treats the LLM as a collaborative assistant with defined constraints rather than an autonomous agent, establishing a model for responsible AI integration in professional settings.

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Define Clear Boundaries**: Developer tooling projects should explicitly state what AI assistants can and cannot do, particularly in enterprise environments where accountability is crucial.

2. **Emphasize Human Oversight**: Establish clear patterns for human verification and final responsibility for all AI-generated content, especially for tools that manage critical infrastructure.

3. **Provide Granular Technical Guidance**: Include specific instructions for code interaction, testing patterns, and development workflows that align with existing project standards.

## Technical Depth

The documentation covers:
- Go development best practices and patterns
- CLI command structure and organization
- Testing strategies for developer tools
- Integration with OpenShift and AWS infrastructure
- Professional development workflows and merge request processes

This example showcases how enterprise developer tooling projects can integrate AI assistance while maintaining strict quality controls, accountability measures, and professional development standards. It serves as an excellent model for teams building CLI tools and developer-facing infrastructure components.
