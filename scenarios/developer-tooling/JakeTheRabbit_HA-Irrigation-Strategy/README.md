- VWC (Volumetric Water Content) monitoring with adaptive thresholds and emergency triggers

### 2. Advanced Home Assistant Architecture
- UI-first configuration approach with modular design
- Custom Home Assistant integration with AppDaemon automation modules
- Centralized configuration management for complex IoT systems

### 3. Statistical Analysis and Data Processing
- IQR outlier detection for sensor data validation
- Trend analysis using scipy for agricultural decision-making
- Multi-scale peak detection algorithms for crop management optimization

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **IoT System Architecture**: Demonstrates how to build sophisticated IoT systems that combine real-time sensor processing with statistical analysis for automated decision-making in specialized domains.

2. **Home Assistant Integration Patterns**: Shows advanced techniques for creating custom integrations that go beyond simple device control to implement complex business logic and automation workflows.

3. **Domain-Specific Automation**: Provides insights into translating expert domain knowledge (precision agriculture) into automated systems with statistical validation and adaptive behavior.

## Distinctive Patterns

- **Four-Phase Automation Cycle**: P0 (Morning dryback) → P1 (Progressive irrigation) → P2 (Maintenance) → P3 (Pre-lights-off dryback)
- **Statistical Validation**: Real-time outlier detection and trend analysis for agricultural decision-making
- **UI-First Configuration**: Home Assistant blueprint-based configuration approach for complex automation systems
