## Why This Example Was Selected

This AGENTS.md file (similar to CLAUDE.md) represents an exceptional example of **Developer Tooling** for API development and code generation:

### 1. **Comprehensive API Toolkit**
Kubb provides a complete solution for API development workflows:
- OpenAPI specification code generation
- TypeScript client generation
- API documentation generation
- Schema validation and transformation
- Multi-framework support (React Query, SWR, etc.)

### 2. **Advanced Code Generation**
Sophisticated code generation capabilities:
- Template-based generation system
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Custom hook generation for React
- Type-safe client generation
- Multi-language output support

### 3. **Developer Experience Optimization**
Focus on improving API development workflows:
- CLI tools for common tasks
- IDE integration and IntelliSense support
- Hot reload and development server
- Validation and linting integration
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 4. **Plugin Architecture**
Extensible plugin system for customization:
- Core plugin API design
- Community plugin ecosystem
- Custom transformation plugins
- Framework-specific integrations
- Third-party tool integrations

### 5. **Modern Development Standards**
Implementation of current best practices:
- TypeScript-first approach
- Modern bundling and build tools
- Testing framework integration
- Performance optimization
- Tree-shaking and code splitting

## Key Takeaways for CLAUDE.md Best Practices

1. **Code Generation Documentation**: Clearly explain complex code generation patterns and templates
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Document extensible plugin systems and their APIs
3. **CLI Tool Design**: Provide comprehensive guidance for command-line tool development
4. **Developer Workflow**: Address complete development workflows from API spec to production
5. **Type Safety**: Document approaches for maintaining type safety across generated code
6. **Framework Integration**: Include guidance for integrating with popular development frameworks

This example demonstrates how a CLAUDE.md file for developer tooling should address both the technical complexity of code generation and the practical aspects of integrating the tool into real-world development workflows, making it easier for contributors to understand and extend the toolkit.
