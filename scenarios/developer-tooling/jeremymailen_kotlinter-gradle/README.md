## Why This Example Was Selected

This CLAUDE.md file represents an excellent example of the **Developer Tooling** category for several compelling reasons:

### 1. **Clear Command Structure**
The file provides a comprehensive list of build and test commands that are essential for working with a Gradle plugin project. It covers:
- Basic build operations (`./gradlew build`)
- Various testing scenarios (all tests, single tests, integration tests)
- Linting and formatting commands for different source sets
- Specific commands for the tool's core functionality

### 2. **Tool-Specific Guidance**
As a linting/formatting tool, kotlinter-gradle requires specific knowledge about:
- Ktlint rule configurations
- Gradle plugin development patterns
- Integration testing approaches
- Code style enforcement

### 3. **Developer Workflow Focus**
The CLAUDE.md file is structured around the actual developer workflow:
- Build → Test → Lint → Format cycle
- Specific commands for different development scenarios
- Integration with existing Gradle ecosystems

### 4. **Maintainability Considerations**
The file includes important notes about:
- Backward compatibility requirements for Gradle plugins
- Custom error handling patterns
- Testing framework specifics (JUnit 5, Gradle TestKit)

## Key Takeaways for CLAUDE.md Best Practices

1. **Command-Centric Organization**: Structure the file around the commands developers will actually run, not just theoretical concepts
2. **Tool-Specific Context**: Include domain-specific knowledge that's crucial for the particular type of tool
3. **Workflow Integration**: Show how the tool fits into existing development workflows and ecosystems
4. **Compatibility Notes**: Include important constraints and compatibility requirements that affect development decisions

This example demonstrates how a CLAUDE.md file for developer tooling should focus on practical, actionable guidance that enables an AI assistant to effectively work with command-line tools and development utilities.
