### 3. Advanced Context Management Strategies
Implements "late chunking" and "context amplification" patterns with Jina v4 embeddings and 32,768 token context windows, showcasing advanced AI/ML integration patterns.

### 4. Comprehensive Development Methodology
Enforces strict Architectural Decision Record (ADR) processes and config-driven development with YAML configurations, demonstrating how complex projects can maintain coherent development practices.

### 5. Progressive Document Processing Patterns
Shows async tools for lazy-loading PDFs, progressive document processing, and multi-database integration - essential patterns for complex data processing systems.

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Document Mathematical Frameworks**: Complex projects with algorithmic components should include formal mathematical documentation to help AI assistants understand the theoretical foundations.

2. **Provide Multi-Component Context**: Document how different system components interact, including databases, external services, and processing pipelines, to enable effective AI assistance across the entire architecture.

3. **Implement Context Amplification**: Use advanced techniques like embedding systems and context management to help AI assistants understand and work with large, complex codebases effectively.
