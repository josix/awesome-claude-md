This CLAUDE.md file from Dan Abramov's personal blog demonstrates comprehensive technical documentation combined with clear personality and style guidance.

## Key Features That Make This Exemplary

### 1. **Complete Development Workflow**
- Provides all essential commands (dev, build, lint, etc.)
- Explains the purpose of each command
- Includes project-specific commands like `postinstall` for patches

### 2. **Detailed Architecture Documentation**
- Explains the static site generation approach
- Maps out the content processing pipeline step-by-step
- Describes advanced MDX features with specific implementation details
- Documents routing patterns and file organization

### 3. **Implementation-Specific Details**
- References exact file paths and their purposes
- Explains technical choices (Next.js 15, React 19, static export)
- Documents advanced features (executable code blocks, theme switching)

### 4. **Strong Style Guidelines**
- Sets clear expectations for commit message tone
- Uses authentic voice ("Don't embarrass me with robot speak")
- Balances professionalism with personality

## Unique Techniques

### **Technical Depth with Context**
Goes beyond surface-level descriptions to explain *why* things work the way they do, including implementation details like `generateStaticParams()` and custom remark plugins.

### **Personality in Professional Documentation**
Demonstrates how to inject authentic voice and standards into technical documentation without losing clarity or professionalism.

### **File-to-Function Mapping**
Clearly connects file paths to their specific responsibilities, making the codebase immediately navigable for an AI assistant.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Balance Detail with Clarity**: Provide comprehensive technical information while maintaining readability
2. **Document Unusual Patterns**: Explain non-standard implementations (like executable code blocks)
3. **Set Style Expectations**: Include clear guidance on communication style and standards

This approach shows how a CLAUDE.md can serve as both a technical reference and a style guide, enabling AI assistants to work effectively while maintaining the project's voice and standards.
