## Why This Example Was Selected

This CLAUDE.md file represents an exceptional example of **Complex Projects & Microservices** for modern Node.js platform development:

### 1. **Enterprise Monorepo Architecture**
Platformatic demonstrates sophisticated monorepo management:
- Multiple interconnected packages and services
- Shared libraries and utilities across packages
- Complex dependency management between packages
- Unified build and deployment strategies
- Cross-package testing and integration

### 2. **Node.js Platform Development**
Advanced Node.js ecosystem development patterns:
- High-performance web server implementations
- Database integration and ORM patterns
- GraphQL and OpenAPI schema generation
- Plugin architecture and extensibility
- Performance optimization and benchmarking

### 3. **Developer Experience Platform**
Focus on simplifying complex development workflows:
- Code generation and scaffolding tools
- Database schema management
- API documentation generation
- Development server with hot reload
- Integrated testing and debugging tools

### 4. **Production-Ready Infrastructure**
Enterprise-grade deployment and operations:
- Docker containerization strategies
- Cloud deployment patterns
- Monitoring and observability integration
- Security best practices
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### 5. **Open Source Project Management**
Professional open source development practices:
- Community contribution guidelines
- Release management across multiple packages
- Documentation standards
- Issue triage and support processes
- Backward compatibility strategies

## Key Takeaways for claude.md Best Practices
