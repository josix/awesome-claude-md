## Project Context

Basic Memory is a cutting-edge memory management and knowledge organization platform that leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless AI-human collaboration. Developed by Basic Machines, it serves as both a production application and a showcase for next-generation AI integration patterns. The project demonstrates how to build sophisticated AI-assisted workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade code quality and architecture.

## Onboarding Guidance

The CLAUDE.md file provides exceptional dual-purpose onboarding:
- **Developer Path**: Comprehensive technical setup with modern Python stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic v2)
- **Product Usage Path**: Clear separation between codebase development and product usage
- **AI Integration Context**: Detailed MCP tool specifications for immediate AI productivity
- **Workflow Documentation**: Step-by-step development and deployment processes

## AI Instructions

Demonstrates sophisticated AI guidance through comprehensive MCP integration:

### **MCP Tool Specifications**
Provides detailed function signatures and parameters for all available MCP tools, organized by functional categories (Content Management, Project Management, etc.).

### **AI-Human Collaborative Workflow**
Documents how AI participates as a full team member through GitHub integration, with persistent knowledge across conversations.

### **Context Preservation Strategies**
Shows practical implementation of maintaining consistency and context across multiple AI development sessions.

### **Knowledge Graph Navigation**
Enables AI to understand and navigate semantic relationships within the project architecture.

## Strengths

### 1. **MCP-First Architecture Documentation**
- **Description**: Treats MCP tools as first-class citizens in the documentation
- **Implementation**: Detailed tool specifications with function signatures and usage examples
- **Impact**: Enables sophisticated AI interactions beyond basic code generation

### 2. **Dual-Purpose Documentation Strategy**
- **Description**: Serves both developers and product users with clear separation
- **Implementation**: Distinct sections for codebase development vs. product usage
- **Impact**: Bridges technical implementation with user experience considerations

### 3. **Production-Ready Development Workflow**
- **Description**: Comprehensive build system with quality gates and automation
- **Implementation**: `just` command runner, pytest/asyncio testing, ruff/pyright tooling
- **Impact**: Maintains professional standards while enabling AI collaboration

### 4. **AI Collaboration Methodology**
- **Description**: Proven approach to human-AI collaborative development
- **Implementation**: GitHub integration, persistent knowledge systems, workflow documentation
- **Impact**: Shows AI as full team member rather than just a coding assistant

## Weaknesses

### Complexity Barrier for Newcomers
- **Issue**: Rich feature set may overwhelm developers new to MCP or AI collaboration
- **Impact**: Steep learning curve for teams not familiar with advanced AI integration patterns
- **Suggestion**: Add "Quick Start" section with minimal viable setup before full feature documentation

## Notable Patterns

### MCP Tool Documentation
```python
# Content Management Tools
- get_content(path: str) -> str
- save_content(path: str, content: str) -> bool
- list_contents(directory: str) -> List[str]

# Project Management Tools  
- create_task(title: str, description: str) -> Task
- update_task_status(task_id: str, status: TaskStatus) -> bool
```
**Explanation**: Provides AI with explicit tool interface specifications, enabling sophisticated automation and context-aware assistance.

### AI Collaboration Workflow
```markdown
## AI Development Process
1. AI reviews current project state via MCP tools
2. AI proposes changes using GitHub integration
3. Human reviews and provides feedback
4. AI implements approved changes
5. Automated testing validates changes
```
**Explanation**: Documents complete AI-human collaborative workflow with clear handoff points and quality gates.

### Knowledge Graph Integration
```markdown
## Semantic Relationships
- Projects contain multiple workspaces
- Workspaces organize related content
- Content maintains version history
- AI agents can navigate these relationships
```
**Explanation**: Shows how to document complex data relationships for AI understanding and navigation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCP Integration First**: Document AI tool interfaces as thoroughly as human APIs
2. **Dual-Purpose Design**: Serve both technical implementers and product users with clear separation
3. **AI as Team Member**: Design workflows where AI participates as colleague, not just tool
4. **Context Preservation**: Implement systems for maintaining knowledge across AI sessions
