# Automated Discovery System

This repository includes an automated system for discovering new CLAUDE.md files across GitHub, helping keep the collection up-to-date without missing valuable examples.

## How It Works

### üîÑ Scheduled Discovery
- **Frequency**: Runs automatically every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Trigger**: GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/discover-claude-files.yml`)
- **Manual Execution**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions interface

### üîç Search Process

The discovery system searches GitHub for repositories containing:
- `CLAUDE.md` (uppercase)

### üìä Quality Evaluation

Each candidate repository is scored using a **content-first approach** that prioritizes educational value over popularity metrics:

#### üìÑ Primary Quality Indicators (70% weight)

**Content Depth & Structure (30 points)**
- Comprehensive architecture documentation
- Clear development workflows and commands
- Testing and deployment guidance
- Troubleshooting and debugging information
- Well-organized file structure and context

**Educational Value (25 points)**
- Demonstrates unique or advanced patterns
- Shows concrete best practices in action
- Provides actionable, specific guidance
- Includes real code examples and snippets
- Teaches transferable techniques

**AI Assistant Effectiveness (15 points)**
- Well-structured for AI consumption
- Clear section headers and organization
- Specific commands and workflows documented
- Context about project goals and constraints
- Actionable information vs. generic advice

#### üîß Secondary Quality Indicators (30% weight)

**Project Maturity (20 points)**
- Active maintenance (recent commits, issues, PRs)
- Evidence of production usage
- Community engagement and responsiveness
- Complete documentation ecosystem
- Established development practices

**Community Recognition (10 points)**
- Industry validation (stars, forks, citations)
- Notable maintainers or organizations
- Referenced in other projects or documentation
- Community adoption and contributions

### üéØ Automatic Categorization

The system suggests appropriate categories based on content analysis:
- **infrastructure-projects**: Runtime environments, platforms, servers
- **complex-projects**: Applications, enterprise systems, microservices
- **developer-tooling**: CLI tools, build systems, generators
- **libraries-frameworks**: SDKs, APIs, integrations
- **getting-started**: Tutorials, examples, starter templates

### üìã Community Review Process

When candidates are found, the system:

1. **Creates GitHub Issue**: Automatically opens an issue with:
   - Ranked list of candidates by quality score
   - Detailed evaluation for each repository
   - Direct links to CLAUDE.md files
   - Suggested categories
   - Quality indicators and reasons

2. **Community Assessment**: Maintainers and contributors review:
   - Quality of CLAUDE.md content
   - Uniqueness of patterns demonstrated
   - Educational value for the community
   - Maintenance status of the repository

3. **Manual Addition**: Approved candidates are manually added:
   - Create analysis files in appropriate categories
   - Update main README.md table of contents
   - Follow established quality standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### GitHub Action Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/discover-claude-files.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly on Mondays
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
```

### Python Discovery Script
```bash
# scripts/discover_claude_files.py
python scripts/discover_claude_files.py
```

**Dependencies**: `requests`, `PyGithub`

**Environment**: Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API access

### Duplicate Prevention
- Scans existing `scenarios/` directory structure
- Extracts repository names from directory naming convention
- Skips repositories already in the collection

## üìà Quality Thresholds

### Scoring Framework
- **Total Score**: 0-100 points (content-quality focused)
- **Acceptance Threshold**: 60+ points (ensures high educational value)
- **Priority Tiers**:
  - **Exceptional (85-100)**: Must-have examples with unique patterns
  - **High Quality (70-84)**: Strong candidates with solid documentation
  - **Good Quality (60-69)**: Solid examples worth including
  - **Below Threshold (<60)**: Needs improvement or inappropriate

### Minimum Requirements
- **Content Quality**: Substantial CLAUDE.md with meaningful documentation
- **File Size**: 1000+ characters (ensures comprehensive content)
- **Repository Status**: Not archived, not a fork
- **Documentation Completeness**: Must have multiple key sections

### Discovery Limits
- **Search Results**: 100 repositories per query (GitHub API limit)
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between API calls
- **Issue Size**: Top 10 candidates featured prominently
- **No Star Minimums**: Quality content accepted from any repository size

## üîß Maintenance

### Manual Triggers
For testing or immediate discovery:
1. Go to repository Actions tab
2. Select "Discover New CLAUDE.md Files" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button

### Issue Management
- Issues created with labels: `automation`, `discovery`, `review-needed`
- Close issues after reviewing and adding approved candidates
- Archive discovery reports for historical tracking

### Monitoring
- Check workflow runs for errors
- Review API rate limit usage
- Monitor issue creation and closure patterns

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the discovery system:
- **Trending Analysis**: Weight recently starred repositories higher
- **Language Detection**: Better categorization based on primary language
- **Content Parsing**: More sophisticated CLAUDE.md content analysis
- **PR Automation**: Auto-create pull requests for high-confidence candidates
- **Notification System**: Alert maintainers of high-priority discoveries

## ü§ù Contributing

To improve the discovery system:
1. **Adjust Criteria**: Modify scoring logic in `scripts/discover_claude_files.py`
2. **Enhance Search**: Add new search queries or filters
3. **Improve Categorization**: Update category suggestion algorithm
4. **Test Changes**: Use manual workflow triggers for validation
