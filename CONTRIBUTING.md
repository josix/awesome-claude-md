# Contributing to Awesome Claude.md

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection! This guide will help you add high-quality examples and maintain the repository's standards.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Find a Great Example**: Look for `claude.md` files in repositories with 100+ stars
2. **Check Our Standards**: Review [CRITERIA.md](CRITERIA.md) for evaluation rubric
3. **Create Analysis**: Write detailed analysis explaining why it's exemplary
4. **Submit Pull Request**: Follow our template and conventions

## üìã Step-by-Step Contribution Process

### Step 1: Identify Potential Examples

#### Search Strategies
Use these GitHub search queries to find quality examples:

```bash
# High-quality repositories with claude.md files
filename:claude.md stars:>100
filename:CLAUDE.md stars:>500

# Specific organizations
filename:claude.md org:microsoft
filename:claude.md org:cloudflare  
filename:claude.md org:anthropic

# By programming language
filename:claude.md language:TypeScript
filename:claude.md language:Python
filename:claude.md language:Rust

# By content patterns
"## Architecture" filename:claude.md
"## Development Commands" filename:claude.md
"## Getting Started" filename:claude.md
```

#### Target Organizations
Prioritize examples from these organizations:
- **Anthropic**: Official AI development practices
- **Basic Machines**: Knowledge management and AI collaboration  
- **Cloudflare**: Infrastructure runtime and developer tooling
- **Microsoft**: AI systems and enterprise tooling
- **PyTorch**: Machine learning infrastructure
- **LangChain**: AI application frameworks

### Step 2: Evaluate Against Criteria

Before proceeding, ensure the example meets our [evaluation rubric](CRITERIA.md):

#### ‚úÖ Essential Requirements (All Must Be Met)
- [ ] **Public Repository**: Accessible with permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
- [ ] **Industry Recognition**: 100+ GitHub stars OR established organization
- [ ] **Active Maintenance**: Commits within last 6 months
- [ ] **Production Usage**: Used in real environments (not just demos)
- [ ] **AI-Friendly Structure**: Clear sections, consistent formatting

#### üèÜ Excellence Score (Target 15+ / 25 points)
Rate 1-5 on each dimension:
- **Onboarding Clarity**: Setup guides, workflows, troubleshooting
- **Architecture Communication**: Component relationships, data flow  
- **Development Workflow**: Commands, testing, debugging
- **AI Context & Instructions**: Specific AI guidance and constraints
- **Technical Depth**: Advanced patterns, edge cases, performance

### Step 3: Determine Category

Choose the most appropriate category:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `complex-projects/` | Multi-service applications with sophisticated architectures | Microsoft Semantic Workbench, Sentry |
| `libraries-frameworks/` | Reusable components, SDKs, framework implementations | LangChain Redis, Composio |
| `developer-tooling/` | CLI tools, build systems, developer productivity | Cloudflare Workers SDK, Lerna |
| `infrastructure-projects/` | Large-scale systems and runtime environments | Cloudflare workerd |
| `getting-started/` | Projects focused on developer onboarding | Anthropic Quickstarts, Ethereum.org |
| `project-handoffs/` | Documentation focused on project state and transitions | Mattermost Test Management |

### Step 4: Create Directory Structure

Create the directory following our naming convention:

```bash
scenarios/[category]/[owner]_[repo]/
```

**Examples**:
- `scenarios/complex-projects/microsoft_semanticworkbench/`
- `scenarios/developer-tooling/cloudflare_workers-sdk/`
- `scenarios/libraries-frameworks/langchain-ai_langchain-redis/`

### Step 5: Write Analysis File

Create `analysis.md` in your new directory using this template:

```markdown

**Repository**: [GitHub Repository URL]  
**Original CLAUDE.md**: [Direct link to the claude.md file]  
**License**: [Repository License]

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Ethical Guidelines

- **Never copy** `claude.md` files directly into this repository
- **Always link** to the original source repository
- **Include proper attribution** with source links and licensing information
- **Respect copyright** and only reference publicly available files under permissive licenses

### Analysis Quality

Your analysis should:
- **Focus on specifics**: Highlight concrete, learnable patterns over generic advice
- **Explain the "why"**: Don't just describe what they do, explain why it's effective
- **Provide actionable insights**: Include takeaways developers can apply to their own projects
- **Use examples**: Quote specific sections or patterns from the original file
- **Maintain objectivity**: Be honest about both strengths and potential limitations

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where relevant
- Structure content with headers and bullet points
- Link to relevant documentation and resources
- Keep technical accuracy as the top priority

## üîç Review Process

### Automated Checks
- License compatibility verification
- Link validation
- Template structure compliance

### Manual Review
1. **Criteria Verification**: Ensure example meets all essential requirements
2. **Quality Assessment**: Score against excellence rubric  
3. **Educational Value**: Verify analysis provides concrete learning value
4. **Writing Quality**: Check clarity, accuracy, and completeness
5. **Community Fit**: Assess alignment with collection goals

### Review Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Review Completion**: Within 1 week for straightforward additions
- **Complex Cases**: May require additional discussion for borderline examples

## üö´ Common Rejection Reasons

- **Insufficient stars/recognition**: Under 100 stars without established organization backing
- **Inactive maintenance**: No commits in 6+ months
- **Poor documentation quality**: Minimal or unclear claude.md content  
- **License restrictions**: Non-permissive licensing that limits reference/analysis
- **Low educational value**: Generic advice without specific, learnable patterns
- **Duplicate coverage**: Similar examples already well-represented

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start with our top picks**: Study examples like [Basic Memory](scenarios/complex-projects/basicmachines-co_basic-memory/analysis.md) to understand our standards

2. **Focus on unique value**: What makes this example different from others we already have?

3. **Be specific in analysis**: Instead of "good documentation," explain "provides Mermaid diagrams showing data flow between services"

4. **Consider the audience**: Write for developers who want to improve their own claude.md files

5. **Test your links**: Ensure all repository and file links work correctly

## ü§ù Getting Help

- **Questions about criteria**: Review [CRITERIA.md](CRITERIA.md) or open an issue
- **Unsure about quality**: Create a draft PR for early feedback
- **Technical issues**: Open an issue with the "help wanted" label
- **General discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader conversations
