**Search for Examples:**
```bash
# GitHub search patterns focused on content quality
filename:claude.md "## Architecture"
filename:CLAUDE.md "## Development Commands"
filename:claude.md "## Testing"
filename:claude.md "## Deployment"
filename:CLAUDE.md org:microsoft
```

### üìù Improving Existing Analyses

Help make our analyses more valuable by:
- Adding missing technical details

- üêõ [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md)

This allows maintainers to provide early feedback and avoid duplicate work.

### 3. **Fork and Clone**

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-claude-md.git
cd awesome-claude-md
```

### 4. **Create Your Branch**

```bash
git checkout -b add-example-project-name
# or
git checkout -b improve-analysis-project-name
